# 2DGcodePlotter
Plots Gcode using Python (2D only)

The option to use arcs (G2 and G3 commands) is still in the works.

I added a few Cycrillic letters for testing. You can however use any Gcode of your own.

The folder is still missing items of course.

Degrees of freedom:

f = 10                    # size increase factor \n
p = 3                     # size of pen tip \n
debugmode = 'y'           # y/n will display coordinates of G0 (goto) commands in window \n
drawcolor = (211,211,211) # RGB code or name e.g. "blue" of color you want to draw with \n
